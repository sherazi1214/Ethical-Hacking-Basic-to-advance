# Ethical-Hacking-Basic-to-advance

### Definition of Ethical Hacking:
Ethical Hacking is the authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. The goal of ethical hacking is to improve system security by fixing vulnerabilities discovered during testing.


### Explanation
Ethical hacking, also known as "white-hat" hacking, involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers operate with the organizationâ€™s permission and follow strict guidelines and legal boundaries. Their goal is to discover vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

Ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks using the same techniques as black-hat hackers, such as exploiting software bugs, insecure configurations, or weak passwords. Once vulnerabilities are found, they report them to the organization, often with recommendations on how to fix or improve the security posture.
